# I made 'Simple Quote'

> Simple Quote is a Discord bot that allows you to quote the messages in a better way.

When a message contains `<messageUrl>`, it sends Url destination as Embed to expression the quote.

Discord now has a reply feature, but replies can't cross channels.

Also it is not intuitive for the viewer, as the replied text is not full and does not show the image or Embed.

This bot solves these problems and makes your Discord server better.

The features of Simple Quote are as follows

- You can copy Embed of the quoted.
- You can quote an image, keeping the spoiler.
- When quoted the message NSFW to SFW, it doesn't visible.
- Like the standard feature, it does not expand for `<messageUrl>`.
- The same goes for videos.

I hope you guys use it.
